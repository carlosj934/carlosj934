# Hi, I'm Carlos 🦧

Solutions Architect with a strong DevSecOps background and over 7 years of experience across high-impact, mission-critical environments.

My career started in the U.S. military and IT help desk, then grew into supporting large-scale, critical infrastructure at Meta and the U.S. Department of State, and now into pre-sales solution architecture at GitLab, where I help customers design and adopt secure, scalable delivery workflows.
